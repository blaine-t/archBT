# archBT

Files I use for my Arch installations.

Scripts for installing Arch.

Run the install scripts in order for it to work.

Scripts install an optionally encrypted bcachefs filesystem with EFISTUBs for boot with Secure Boot support. Comes with KDE Plasma X11 and/or Wayland. Also comes with patches for using Wayland on optional applications. Used for the "Ultimate Arch Install"
